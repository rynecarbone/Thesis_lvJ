A search for new diboson resonances in the boosted semi-leptonic final state at √s = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector

A search is presented for new resonances decaying to a pair of boosted Standard Model bosons, WV, 
where the W boson decays leptonically (W → lν, with l = e, μ) and the other
weak boson, V (V = W, Z), decays hadronically (V → qq ̄ /qq ̄, with q, q = u, d, c, s, b). 
The data were collected with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, during the 2015 and 2016 periods 
of pp collisions, at a center-of-mass energy √s = 13 TeV, and correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 36.1fb−1. 
The hadronic decay of the boosted V boson is reconstructed as a single large-radius jet, and the leptonic decay of the 
W boson is reconstructed as a lepton and missing transverse energy. The search is sensitive to 
resonances produced with quark-antiquark fusion, gluon-gluon fusion, and vector-boson fusion. 
No significant excesses are observed above the Standard Model background prediction. 
Upper limits on production cross section times branching ratio to WV are set at a 95% confidence level for 
selected benchmark signal models. Models of a neutral, narrow scalar boson (spin-0), 
charged and neutral vector bosons (spin-1) coupling to the Standard Model gauge bosons, 
and a neutral Randall-Sundrum bulk graviton (spin-2) are considered. 
The search significantly improves the limits produced in recent searches.
